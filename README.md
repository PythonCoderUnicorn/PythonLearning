# Python learning

My Machine Learning repo for all my code of ML, Deep Learning, NLP projects

---
This repo is to track my progress of learning code outside any code bootcamp or online training. The aim is to break out of the
endless loop of tutorials and make my own projects using different data. Part of the projects are from tutorials and the pther is 
my own. Let's see what I can do!
